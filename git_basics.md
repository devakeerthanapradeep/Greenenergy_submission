### git init
This command starts a new Git repository in the current folder. It creates a hidden .git directory where Git will track project history.

### git add
This stages changes (new/modified files) to be included in the next commit. It prepares selected files for a snapshot but does not save them permanently yet.

### git commit
This saves the staged changes as a new snapshot in the repository history with a message. Each commit documents a point-in-time state of the project.

### git push
This sends your local commits to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub). It updates the remote so others (or your backups) get your changes.
